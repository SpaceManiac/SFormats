SFormats
========

SFormats is a collection of Python scripts using the
[Construct](http://construct.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) declarative data
parsing library to define a few different file formats I've worked with and
had to parse over the years.

Each structure file has a brief description of its purpose in the header.

Flash
-----
At one point I was attempting to write a Flash (ActionScript 3) decompiler.
I never quite got it working, but I did manage to parse SWF files, ActionScript
code blocks, and AS3 bytecode instructions.

Hamumu
------
I've done a lot of work relating to [Hamumu](http://hamumu.com/) games, and
in the process of this work had to parse graphics, world data, and save and
profile data.
